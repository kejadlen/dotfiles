# vim: set ft:tmux

# This was messing with the `PATH` (`path_helper` shenanigans perhaps?), and
# it seems like `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are working now, so maybe it's not
# needed anymore?

# set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
# bind y run "tmux save-buffer - | reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"
set-option -g default-command "zsh"
bind y run "tmux save-buffer - | pbcopy"
